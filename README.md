# mood-ring

## Description
This app is currently at mvp stage and is still a work in progress.

My initial idea was to revive the 1970s phenomenon of the mood ring. Mood rings track changes in body temperature and then convey that through changes in color (warm colors for higher temperatures, cool colors for low). This app scrapes data from Twitter on a given topic and then passes the data through sentiment analysis. It then translates the analysis to rgb and pushes each color to the computer screen.

## Learning objectives
JavaScript animation, HTML/CSS, websockets, sentiment-analysis, scraping/rendering, algebra.
